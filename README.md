# Other Traversing Methods - Challenge 2

## Instructions

Return to the table challenge. When a table header is clicked, the corresponding row should highlight. When another table header (on the row) is clicked, the corresponding row should highlight, and all others should turn white. Add extra rows if you need to. Traverse the DOM to find a solution.
